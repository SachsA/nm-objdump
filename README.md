Epitech, SECOND year Project. C Unix Memory : recode Malloc.

The goal of the project is to recode two functions of the C library :

--> nm

--> objdump -f -s

To compile : make.
To compile only nm : make nm.
To compile only objdump : make objdump

To recompile the project : make re.

To clean all : make fclean.

-----> It will compile you two binaries : ./my_nm and ./my_objdump.

These two binaries work with :
• Relocatable files .o
• Shared files .so
• Executable files
